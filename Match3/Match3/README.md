<h3 align = "center"> This is a work in progress game </h3>

I'm intending to make a grid of numbers that's made of 1's, 2's and 3's and you would have to match 3 of them. You can only "access" the numbers which are open to the
bottom. From those you have to pick 3 of them using the numbers on your keyboard. When you've selected a number it will move into one of the 3 spaces and dissapear from
the board.
