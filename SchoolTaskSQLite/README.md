<h1 align="center"> SchoolTask Student Database with SQLite </h1>

I've gotten a lot of help with the SQLite stuff from Pobiega#2671 on discord where he's explained what everything is and helped code a lot of it.
It's a simple database where you can Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) info on students.
This was originally just a project from a teacher I requested to get, but turned out to be a more personal learning project.
