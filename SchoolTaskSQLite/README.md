I've gotten a lot of help with the SQLite stuff from Pobiega#2671 on discord where he's explained what everything is and helped code a lot of it.
It's a simple database where you can Add, Update, Remove and Get info on students.
This was originally just a project from a teacher I requested to get, but turned out to be a more personal learning project.
