<h1 align="center"> SchoolTask Student Database </h1>

<h4> This is a student database where you can Add, Update, Remove and Get info on students. It's pretty simple but I think it was a good way for me to learn more about
C# and how it works with saving data and so on. </h4>

I've chosen to use JSON as I've worked previously with it before in processing and knew how it kinda worked.

This was a project I asked from the teacher where he told me I could either use a normal file or a database.
