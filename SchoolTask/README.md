<h1 align="center"> SchoolTask Student Database </h1>

<h4> This is a student database where you can Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) students. </h4>

It's pretty simple but I think it was a good way for me to learn more about C# and how it works with saving data and so on.
I've chosen to use JSON as I've worked previously with it before in processing and knew how it kinda worked.

This was a project I asked from the teacher where he told me I could either use a normal file or a database.
